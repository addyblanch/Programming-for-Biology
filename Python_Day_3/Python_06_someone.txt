Rebecca by Shel Silverstein

Rebecca loves me,
Rebecca cares,
Rebecca picks me peaches and pears.
Rebecca offers me candy and Cokes,
Rebecca listens and laughs at me jokes.
Rebecca helps when I get in a fight,
Rebecca does all my homework at night.
Rebecca misses me,
Rebecca cries,
Rebecca thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Rebecca is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Rebecca just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Rebecca's hand,
In the darkness where Rebecca usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Rebecca's gone!
